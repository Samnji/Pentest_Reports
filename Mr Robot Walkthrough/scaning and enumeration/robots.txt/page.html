<title>robots.txt</title>
</head><body>I went ahead to enumerate the robots.txt and found 2 files which were not encrypted and had permisions to read and write.<br/>
<br/>
<b><span style="font-size: 13pt">First File: </span></b><span style="font-size: 13pt">fsocity.dic</span><br/>
It was a wordlist file that was later used to bruteforce the login page.<br/>
So i went ahead and downloaded the file with the following command;<br/>
<b>Command: wget </b>http://192.168.5.129/fsocity.dic<br/>
Then went ahead and checked the word count of the file with the following command;<br/>
<b>Command: wc <br/>
</b>where i noticed it was a large file. So sorted the file and removed duplicates and dumped the results to another file call fsocity_unique.dic with the following command;<br/>
<b>Command: sort</b>&nbsp;fsocity.dic | <b>uniq</b>&nbsp;&gt; fsocity_unique.dic<br/>
This ensured that the login bruteforce wouldn't take that much of the time to crack the login details. <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 13pt"><b>Second File: </b>key-1-of-3.txt<br/>
</span>So i went ahead and downloaded the file with the following command;<br/>
<b>Command: wget </b>http://192.168.5.129/<span style="font-size: 13pt">key-1-of-3.txt<br/>
</span>Then went ahead and checked the contents of the file with the following command;<br/>
<b>Command: cat </b>key-1-of-3.txt<br/>
And thats how i found first flag or key.<br/>
It was the first flag file with the first key.</body></html>
